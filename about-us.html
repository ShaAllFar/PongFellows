      <p>And God is still speaking. We are the party of Kennedy.

The press has scoured every exit poll for the latest evidence of racial polarization, not just in terms of white and black, but black and brown as well. Let us be our sister's keeper. This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort. The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things. Those are not just American ideas, they are human rights, and that is why we will support them everywhere. Countries like Japan and South Korea grew their economies while maintaining distinct cultures.</p>

      <p>We're not going to agree on everything, but we can disagree without being disagreeable. Of course, the answer to the slavery question was already embedded within our Constitution - a Constitution that had at is very core the ideal of equal citizenship under the law; a Constitution that promised its people liberty, and justice, and a union that could be and should be perfected over time. Legalized discrimination - where blacks were prevented, often through violence, from owning property, or loans were not granted to African-American business owners, or black homeowners could not access FHA mortgages, or blacks were excluded from unions, or the police force, or fire departments - meant that black families could not amass any meaningful wealth to bequeath to future generations. It's a racial stalemate we've been stuck in for years. And as so many generations have come to realize over the course of the two-hundred and twenty one years since a band of patriots signed that document in Philadelphia, that is where the perfection begins. And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."</p>
